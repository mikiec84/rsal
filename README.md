## Repository Storage Abstraction Layer

### overview
This is an abstraction layer for dataset storage, designed to integrate with repository software.
More particularly, for mediating network access to datasets without going through the repository application server, and allowing for access through non-http protocols.

It will probably be renamed once we come up with a better name.
Analogous to DCM, this is starting as mocks/stubs (for Dataverse integeration) and adaption of existing backend code.

Endpoints / messages are still flexible.
